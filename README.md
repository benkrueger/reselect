**Organization:** ResElect  
**Website:** [www.ResElect.org](http://www.ResElect.org)

**Purpose:**  
To create a robotic CNC system capable of disassembling obsolete or discarded electronic circuit boards and reclaiming reusable microchips, providing a potential safeguard against disruptions in the global semiconductor supply chain.

## Project Summary

The **ResElect** initiative proposes the development of a **Semiconductor Reclamation & Recovery System**. This robotic CNC system would use precision tooling and machine learning to reverse-engineer the disassembly of circuit boards, thereby reclaiming reusable microchips from outdated or surplus electronics. In the event of a semiconductor supply chain crisis, ResElect would provide a critical backstop for maintaining and repairing essential technology systems.

### Process Overview

1. **Reflow System**
    - **Purpose:** The reflow system would carefully heat circuit boards, loosening solder connections without damaging delicate components.
    - **Design:** Options include a programmable infrared light source or an oven-style reflow system. The IR system offers precision for small, targeted areas, minimizing thermal impact on adjacent components.
2. **High-Speed Robotic Tweezers**
    - **Purpose:** Once components are freed, precision tweezers extract individual microchips.
    - **Design:** The tweezers are designed to move quickly, with adjustable force control to avoid damaging the components. The robotic arm will position chips onto a conveyor system for testing.
3. **Vision System and AI Model**
    - **Purpose:** An integrated high-resolution vision system, paired with a machine learning model, will locate and identify chips on each circuit board.
    - **Design:** The AI model will be trained to recognize various chip types and orientations, helping guide the tweezersâ€™ movement for accurate retrieval. Vision-based inspection also verifies chip integrity before and after removal.
4. **Sorting and Testing**
    - **Purpose:** Extracted chips are tested for functionality and sorted based on quality, type, and specifications.
    - **Design:** The sorting system categorizes chips, directing viable ones for resale, reuse, or further testing. Functional chips are processed for quality assurance and, if needed, reformatted or updated to meet standard operating conditions.

## Grant Purpose

Grant funds will be utilized to:

1. **Prototype Development** - Constructing the initial system for proof-of-concept, including robotic arms, the reflow system, and the AI-powered vision component.
2. **Training and Data Collection** - Compiling a dataset of board layouts and chip types to train the machine learning model effectively.
3. **Testing Lab Establishment** - Creating a controlled environment for testing the functional integrity of reclaimed chips.

## Economic Viability and Sustainability

While primarily designed for crisis preparedness, the ResElect system offers several paths to economic sustainability:

- **Sales of Reclaimed Components** - Extracted chips in high demand, especially legacy components, could be sold to companies needing replacements for older systems.
- **Partnerships with E-Waste Facilities** - By collaborating with e-waste recycling firms, ResElect can offer specialized chip recovery services.
- **Technology Licensing** - The underlying robotic technology and AI model could be licensed to industries requiring sustainable access to critical components, such as defense, aerospace, and medical equipment sectors.

## Investment Pitch or Grant Appeal

While unlikely to be profitable in traditional markets, **ResElect** serves as a resilience measure for critical technology. This initiative could prove vital during global semiconductor shortages or disruptions, supporting essential systems and helping avert widespread technology-related crises.
