AI Strategy for ResElect: Semiconductor Reclamation & Recovery System
Overview
AI is essential to the ResElect system for enabling precision in component recognition, extraction, and testing. The process of identifying, retrieving, and validating semiconductor components from circuit boards requires multiple AI models, each fulfilling a unique role. Below is a summary of the AI-driven model types and the hardware requirements to run these models effectively in real-time.

Key AI Models
Object Detection and Classification Model

Purpose: To identify and classify various semiconductor components on circuit boards.
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN, for real-time object detection.
Training Needs: The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of board layouts and components, including images of different chip types, angles, and lighting conditions to ensure high accuracy.
Output: Real-time bounding boxes around recognized components and classification labels for each component.
Pose Estimation Model

Purpose: To determine the orientation and alignment of each component for precise tweezer positioning.
Model Type: Keypoint detection networks, potentially based on models like OpenPose or DeepLab, to locate essential landmarks on the components.
Training Needs: Annotated data on component positions, angle variations, and positions relative to board markings.
Output: Precise coordinates and orientation angles for components, allowing the robotic arm to adjust its grasp accordingly.
Anomaly Detection Model

Purpose: To assess the physical condition of each component, identifying potential defects or damage during removal.
Model Type: Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning, possibly leveraging autoencoders or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify abnormalities compared to standard component images.
Training Needs: A dataset of intact vs. defective chips, capturing subtle visual cues like scratches, warping, or discoloration that indicate a compromised chip.
Output: Pass/fail flag for each component, with failed chips discarded or flagged for further testing.
Quality Prediction Model for Testing

Purpose: To predict the probability of a chip functioning based on initial visual and environmental factors before testing.
Model Type: Supervised learning with logistic regression or neural networks trained on known chip defect indicators.
Training Needs: Historical data correlating visual indicators and environmental factors with chip performance outcomes.
Output: A confidence score indicating the likelihood of a component passing quality tests.
Sorting and Categorization Model

Purpose: To sort recovered components based on type, functionality, and condition for streamlined testing and reuse.
Model Type: Clustering algorithms or classification models to categorize components.
Training Needs: Datasets including component types, specifications, and intended use applications.
Output: Labels and categories for each chip, directing them to specific conveyor paths for testing, packaging, or secondary processing.
Hardware Requirements
High-Performance GPUs

Purpose: To handle real-time processing of vision-based AI models, especially during component recognition and anomaly detection.
Recommended GPUs: NVIDIA A100 or Tesla V100 for inference tasks; A100 is optimal for heavy models, while Tesla V100 can support multiple models with parallel processing.
Memory Needs: 32 GB per GPU, ensuring sufficient capacity to manage large image datasets and complex neural networks.
Edge Processing Units (EPUs)

Purpose: To run AI models close to the hardware for low-latency image recognition and positioning tasks, useful in controlling the robotic arm.
Recommended EPUs: Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick or NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, offering accelerated image processing for real-time control.
Placement: EPUs would be installed on each robotic unit to allow for responsive adjustments based on the AI output.
High-Resolution Cameras

Purpose: Providing detailed visual data for accurate AI processing, particularly for object detection and defect analysis.
Specifications: Cameras capable of capturing at least 4K resolution, with adjustable zoom and focus to accommodate varying board sizes and component detail levels.
Central Processing Server

Purpose: To manage overall coordination, model training updates, and component dataset storage.
Specifications: A multi-core CPU server with high-speed SSD storage and networked GPU support for large-scale dataset processing and model retraining.
